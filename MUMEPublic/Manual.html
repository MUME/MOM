<FONT color=#000099 size=4><A name=#connecting>Connecting to MUME</A></FONT>
<pre>
After installing MUMEOnlineMap.msi run <B>setup.exe</B>.
Do everything setup suggests and then you can start the program.
Also start your client JMC/PowTTY/ZMUD/etc.

Now connecting from client to MOM you must use address <b>localhost</b> 
and the localhost port by default is <b>1001</b>.
Example in JMC: <FONT color=#00ff00><b>#connect localhost 1001</b></font>
that connects to MOM what works as a proxy and connects to MUME.

You can change the MUME address/port and localhost port in Windows registry.
The path to registry: \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\LangSoft\MUME Online Map\

No evil zones are premapped, only most travelled roads and good towns,
and meaning is to help new players. I suggest you first create a new char
and pray to Gray Havens. Then you can start testing the program.
</pre>
<P><A name=#online><FONT color=#000099 size=4>MOM Online help</FONT></A>
<PRE>
The MOM commands start with '_' sign. Type: _help
If you see the help, then you can be sure that the Client and MOM are connected.<BR>
</pre>


<P><A name=#locate><FONT color=#000099 size=4>Locating the character</FONT></A>
<pre>The roads are the backbone of Arda, from here you can start travelling and mapping yourself.
If you want a blank map, then just delete everything inside map.txt file.

<b>To located yourself, You must configure some MUME and MOM values.</b>
In MUME you must type:
<b><FONT color=#00ff00>change look colour green</FONT></b>
In MOM menu 
<b><FONT color=#00ff00>SET->Look foreground colour->Green</font></b>
Basically the MUME look colour and MOM colours must match each other.
<b>The room colour in MUME, must be used only once in colours!</b>

<B>Example</B>: If you used to have in MUME change colours <B>look, say, tell</B> as GREEN,
then now you must use GREEN only for look and say/tell must be changed to LIGHT GREEN(bold green).

If you want to use BOLD BLUE colour to see room names, then
In MUME: change colour look BOLD BLUE
In MOM: SET->Look foreground colour->BOLD
In MOM: SET->Look foreground colour->BLUE
<B>NB! </b>And remember that in MUME BOLD BLUE must be used only for LOOK!

To get the player and map located, walk in MUME to mapped spot and type <FONT color=#00ff00><b>_sync</b></font>
If everything is correct, then there will be an "Ok".

</pre>

<A name=#moving><FONT color=#000099 size=4>Moving the map and character</FONT></A>
<pre>
The MOM accepts only short move commands: 'n','e','s','w','u','d'
The long 'north' will be considered as RAW command and will not move the map.
It also accepts the speedwalk, like 'nnneeennneuud'
You can move map by double clicking on it.
Try moving the map and move around.

</pre>

<P><A name=#mapping><FONT color=#000099 size=4>Mapping</FONT></A><BR>
<pre>
To start mapping just press the <FONT color=#00ff00>MAP</FONT> button.
In mapping mode, the character and program goes always out of sync.
Now you can resize the map window and a larger map is shown.
You can bind all the MOM online commands under buttons or your own aliases.

People who use JMC I suggest you bind like:
Shift + Numpad8 -&gt; _mapnorth
Shift + Numpad2 -&gt; _mapsouth
and so on.. then bind the map moving commands(if you don't want to use the mouse):
Ctrl + Numpad8 -&gt; _movemapnorth
Ctrl + Numpad2 -&gt; _movemapsouth

People who do not use keybinding clients, you could make client aliases like:
#alias -e _mapeast
#alias -n _mapnorth
and so forth.

Now find some unmapped spot and try map some rooms:

</pre>
<A name=#portals><FONT color=#000099 size=4>Creating portals</FONT></A>
<pre><IMG src="http://www.itcollege.ee/~jlang/MUME/images/mom.gif">
Check the MOM menu VIEW options, there you can turn viewing doornames, portals and grid ON.
Press MOM <b><FONT color=#00ff00>Tools</font></b> button to see the Mapping Tools window.

To create a portal, you must select a room and press press left mouse button down and hold it.
Drag the mouse cursor to room where the portal will go and release the mouse button.
You will see a green rectangle appear, showing the coordinates of the start and end room.
In the Tools window, there are two sets of radiobuttons(left and right).
The left radiobutton column represents the first room and the right the second room.
Select the first room direction from where the portal will go out
and select the second room direction where the portal will bring.
After this select the middle buttons, as is it both ways or oneway left to right or vice versa.
Click CREATE PORTAL and you are done! Of course the portal only appears if the exits existed!

</pre>

<A name=#example><FONT color=#000099 size=4>An example how to map.</FONT></A>
<pre>Basically, you locate(_sync) yourself on map, then go 
to mapping mode and just start shift+dir mapping,
when you discover 
that the mapped room is not the terrain what is currently active, then 
just click on the right terrain, and click UPDATE. If you need to 
specify doors and portals in mapped room, just add the values to correct 
textboxes and click UPDATE.

Don't forget to save the map, what can be done in mapping mode.
Also sometimes take backups of your map, before you start doing huge cut and paste.

</pre>

<A name=#hints><FONT color=#000099 size=4>Hints</FONT></A>
<li>Map all the roads before everything else, then you can be sure everything is ok.
<li>There is a 1 room gap between rivendell and khuzur.
<li>Map all the outside areas(watchout town areas are not outside!),
before mappnig dungeons or cities
<li>If everything around the dungeons or caves is mapped, you can find the place to map the cave.
<li>First explore the cave and try to memorize its depth and size, so you can be sure it fits.
<li>Later don't forget to make portals(links) between the outside entrance to dungeon and backwards!
<li>After mapping, get in _sync and test the area or atleast the portal connections!
<li>You need to do this only once, if you are good, so make it worth!
<li>You could use portal to next room to represent climb rooms.
<li>Randoms can be mapped only the correct path.
<li>There are rooms on Arda, where roomname and description are the same or can't be mapped(don't mind this).
<li>Put some effort into mapping areas, because you have to do this only once.
