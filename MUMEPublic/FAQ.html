<UL>Q stands for Question<BR>A stands for Answer<BR>
<P>Q: <B>I have a problem what is not listed here</B><BR>A: Please 
e-mail me and give as much details as possible:<BR>e-mail : 
<B>jaanus@it.ee</B><BR>subject: <B>MUME_Online_Map_Feedback</B><BR>- 
your operating system(version)<BR>- whad did you do, when the error occured<BR>- do you have 
administrative rights<BR>- see "log.txt"<BR>
<P>Q: <B>Wrong protocol or connection state for the requested 
transaction or request(40006)</B><BR>A: MOM is running, but your 
client(JMC/Telnet/..) is not running or not connected to MOM,<BR>this 
error doesn't cause any bad. You can still modify your map 
offline.<BR>You should delete your -log.txt- file sometimes, because it 
can get too large.<BR>
<P>Q: <B>My map does not locate</B><BR>A: The character you play must 
have MUME command CHANGE COLOUR LOOK with correct colour!<BR>The MUME 
colour must be one of the colours listed in Options/Change colour 
look/-colour-<BR>There is a difference between -bold green- and 
-green-!<BR>
<P>Q: <B>My map located(synced) properly, but for some reason it won't 
follow</B><BR>A: MOM only accepts following movement commands:<BR>[n e s 
w u d] or their combinations [nesewudwn], [n;e;s;e;w;u;d;w;n],<BR>MOM 
does not support movement typed like [eas sou so nort up dow],<BR>that 
command is not recognized by MOM and sent straight to MUME.<BR>
<P>Q: <B>Gathering room data: GETTING DATA FROM MUME FAILED!</B><BR>A: 
The information you got was invalid, invalid data can be caused 
by:<BR>mapping to closed direction or,<BR>mapping too fast, - you cannot 
do anything else when the MOM reads room data<BR>there was 
some/narrate/yell spam in room, that sometimes comes 
between<BR>descripton and exits data and can ruin the format. Then you 
will either see,<BR>Q: <B>Black square border appears around the 
room</B><BR>A: This means the data is invalid or the mapper could not 
gather EXITS information,<BR>in some cases entering the room shows the 
exits, but the separate command will not.<BR>Then just manually click 
all the existing exit directions True.<BR>
<P>Q: <B>Is there any fast command for MAPMODE (or some 
similar)</B><BR>A: Yes. _help gives overall command list, and the 
command you are looking for is _tool<BR>
<P>Q: <B>When I downloaded the installer and tried to run it,<BR></B>it 
asked me what application I wanted to use to open the program.<BR>A: You 
must download Windows Installer from MS Windows website.<BR>W95/W98/ME
