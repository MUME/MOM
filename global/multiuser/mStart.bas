' This BAs module gives you the code you need to implement the
' Java out-of-process style threading model in VB.  Just
' add it to an ActiveX EXE, reference Runnable.TLB and then
' do this in your ActiveX EXE:
'
' Implements Runnable
'
' Public Sub Start()
'     mStart.Start Me
' End Sub
'
' Private Sub IRunnable_Start()
'     ' Do your code here.  It will run async against
'     ' the calling app.
' End Sub
