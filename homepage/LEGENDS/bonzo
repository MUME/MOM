teine tuli automaatselt, ja ruumi desc tuli samal
ajal ette kui suddenly very silent...anyways sorry

olex mul siis endal mingi link olnud...eq-st kablutas
ka raffas yle selle olex kyll alles j2tnud kui sust
lootijat olex olnud...shadowd nicht ja
ok, keep cool ja vabandused...nii killi saada pole

Meaning:
damndamn, link was fucked from both sides...that i
stabbed you first time, was ok(understandable),
but the second came automatically *//WTF does he MEAN BY THAT??//*
and rooms descs were shown the same time when 'suddenly very silent....'
anyway sorry, i have been with the same situtation myself and been mad..
if i atleast had the link myself...
eq-  was also spammed away by "people", i would have left it there,
if you could have looted *//wtf that means?//*...there was no shadow
and ok, keep cool and sorry...to kill you that way doesnt make me stoned.
