Because the Clan adding moderators e-mail in some latvia is full, I am putting this info here!

The Hand of Sauron - The Hand has five main leaders. The leaders share the wrath as they please.

The qualifications for the Hand are high:
- You must be evil Orc (roleplaying evil, snagas are only good to eat).
- In all your evilness and might, there is a line, when you become a moron.
- You cannot be a moron. There has to be a cause.
- Everything you own, must have been gained by force or magic! Including your den.
- You cannot be neutral about anything.
- There is no right or wrong, but one dead and the other alive, or there can be many.

Member of the Hand can have a huge den, where his snagas/females(followers) work for him.
If the followers can manage to stay alive, they can will grow in wealth and power.
Finally, the follower can call out his leader and challenge him,
where victory will make him a new leader of the Hand. 

Sauron is our Lord and Loremaster our spiritual member, both must be protected by all cost.
We rule the Orc Caves. The Great Goblin is our puppet, we are his masters.
All the other puppets(other players) in Caves must obey or fight for their right.
We don't have to ask for anything, it will be given to us or we take by force.
Wrath is our weapon and puppets our tools.

The titles of the Hand:
"Diamonium Dagamatri, the Ambassador of Sauron"
".. the Eye of Sauron"
".. the Mouth of Sauron"
".. the Right Hand of Sauron"
".. the Left Hand of Sauron"

The Ambassador recruits new members and gives them appropriate titles ".. the .. of Sauron".
