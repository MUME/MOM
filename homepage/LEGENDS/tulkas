TITLES

Legends on MUME can choose their own title. While they have great freedom in
choosing it, a basic rule must be obeyed: a legend's title must not provide
false information. Examples of forbidden titles:

- Wiz the Elven Apprentice of Magic (a legend is not a level 1)
- Panoramix the White (title reserved to the Tan Istar)
- Joe the Orc.  (when joe is actually a human)

Also avoid putting [Retired], (Linkless), (Idle) in your title. Also one should
avoid using stat-related terms such as "23rd level" or "19 Wis" as part as the
title on RP grounds.

Also be aware, that all titles should refer to the player in question. Hence
the title "Slash is a jerk" is not acceptable. Also the title should be
something that other players would find acceptable.

Unless your title is a name or similar, it shall be in English.
