Ok is saw a noname dwarf..when i went to dt..where pukes had just slayed Dexter
..they had also whacked the guards..
i targeted the noname dwarf..because he was so greedy to get a whack on me..
later he had (Linkless) flag dunno why..but had sometimes spells spammed before
so he ate some at linkless also!, sorry bout that..lagged a lil..but in the end
ull see that lag was kinda quite fatal

Mostly the problem was that warg ZBLAMMED me some fucken a dozen times,
because he was too tired..that fucked me up..later picked up that fainting warg!
