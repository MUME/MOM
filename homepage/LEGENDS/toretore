Well I know Moria by heart and I tracked at all intersections, following

*comfort* on death anyhow, and credits to you for having the guts to
try stab in a balrog group. You ran fast and fought well.

Holyelf tells you 'orc w5 at hidden stair'

You sense a hidden lifeform in the room.

You strike *Nah the Orc* blah blah
