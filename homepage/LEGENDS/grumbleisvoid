Ok i was sooooooooo bored, i woke up at 6 in the morning:P rl
and started computer and logged nah on...
2 hours lame spamming, did some draught lore stuff,
no pukes around. So i tracked one elf to khuzur but ran into him
so missed stab he got away. Then i was going to rent,
but popped trugh dt, to get new fresh mount, then met gamble, near
noc bridge. Tracked him down til dt, he sprayed me some 120 hps.
Forgot amulet to pouch:P. Ok sun was already up, 
he blocked dt door i had Moves:Tired, but dismounted and bsed him
2w dt door under sun to awful he spam fled to rdell,
cough up with him and pierced some he was fine already.
Then he went inside. Grenade was around ford, and told me that Elle
is coming to ford. SO sun raised trolls fled i had moves low again.
Then elle and gamble. See what happens...they both clueless trackers.
