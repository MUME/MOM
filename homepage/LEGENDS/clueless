Ok what happened, i was logged on with Hit(Dolengur),
and started spamming where the fuck did hobbits go,
so i spammed quite alot i mean and then one snaga
started to scream that i shouldnt spam and it disturbs him!
Ok well, i usually dont forget to answer..so he got a lil upset.
Burzum called me to warrens to grp up and whack the wobbits,
i went there, also otoros was ther and told that i should leave
and im disturbing him, i told him to fugg of and start walking.
He told that he will bash me, i told go ahead..and got quite
beaten up. I was level 22..ok was at 130/344hps
