*********************************
Noticed some elf and human tracks going into maze.
Met Elf (Destil) at 3. floor and fought him
He decided to die on vampire bat instead of me..
tracked human  (17 hours old tracks)
finally got to him

about my link
when i checked post for pukes
i had dirs spammed all over to reach post
wolfpack hit me on the middle of my spam
i killed whole wolfpack , that is 6 wolves
and waited 5 seconds, and run forward to post where i started fleeing suddenly
so , go figure...
I still decided to go pk with my link
That was my fatal mistake, my rule, never play with luck (I dont have any) its the skill
what counts.
