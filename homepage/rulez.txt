Argh! You fools! Be silent and listen!

We will never win this war if this inner battle continues.
The big boss Bulgotha, the Captain of the Zaugurz outpost
is too busy to deal with you snagas and gave me orders
to make something straight!

IF You want to MEND something and there is someone before you,
You will ask if he is FINISHED, otherwise you have been WARNED!

IF You want to go kill and need some weapons from the northern
outposts, be PATIENT and wait before the fellow zaugurz has
LOOTED his equipment from the cart, otherwise you have been WARNED!

IF an alarm bell rings in our Caves, YOU BETTER GET TO ARMS!

IF you want some equipment, then the first thing to do
is get all the worthy equipment from ground(caves)
(bladders, skins, food, shields, weapons, armour)
lying around and throw the armour/shields to CRACK !
All the weapons to Weaponsmaster's RACK !
Otherwise when you are naked, you know WHY YOU ARE NAKED !

IF some powerful zaugurz tells you to piss off,
gain strength, be silent and RETALIATE!

IF you want mobility! All the boots and forest green cloaks
you find outside or steal/loot from others.
Put it inside CRACK !, WHEN and IF you reach the caves again.

In cunning and treachery we rely! Otherwise we are already dead!

IF you see a fishing pole by the underground river,
near the Scout Master, use it and DROP IT!
If I see someone taking that with him, next thing you
will see is His CORPSE stabbed by a spear,
the spear starting from his arse
and coming out from his mouth holding the fishpole !

Show NO WEAKNESS(es) to our enemies, no bitching! no whining!
KILL THEM!
Pierce their eyes, slash their balls, pound their arse!

These were the words told to me by Bulgotha,
the Captain of the Zaugurz outpost. OBEY or RETALIATE!

Lack of information/commands is not an EXCUSE !

Cen the Ambassador of Bulgotha,
the Captain of the Zaugurz outpost.
